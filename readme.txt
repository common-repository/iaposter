Automatically pins images from your posts to your Pinterest account.

== Description ==
Image Auto Poster allows you to automatically post images from your blog posts to your Pinterest account. You select images that should be pinned while working on your post. Once the post is published, selected images are automatically being posted to your Pinterest account. No more posting your images to your account by hand.

## Features ##

**Image detection**: the plugin automatically detects images from your post and lists them in a meta box next to the editor.

**Choose images that should be pinned**: you choose images that should be pinned by selecting checkboxes next to them.

**Boards detection**: Once you authorize the plugin to use your Pinterest account, you can choose which board you want to pin images to.

**Pins link to your posts**: exacly the same way as if images were pinned from the frontend.

**Default pin description with tags**: You set the pin description using a set of available tags, so you don't need to write a description for each images.
